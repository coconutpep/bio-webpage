  <p id="para1">Hello, I am Ryan Klueg and I am currently a Data Assesment Assistant with the Judge Ben C. Green Law Library at Case Western Reserve university. I have Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Chemistry from Ohio University and a certificate in Data Analytics and Visualization from Case Western University and 5+ years of experience working in academia primarily in a library setting. Proven technical and leadership aptitude in data analysis and management environments. Qualifications encompass partnering with other departments using Excel, and various library databases (e.g. Ebsco, OhioLink, Illiad) to inventory thousands of articles and books to assist researchers in the creation of a Meta-Analysis of Meta-Analyses. Skilled in Python, VBA, SQL, and data visualization tools such as JavaScript and HTML. Finds great satisfaction in extracting insights from data that inform decision-making and provides resources for greater community support.</p>
  <p>I bring along with me a deep desire for learning and knowledge. This is not limited to academia as I find myself practicing a variety of skills ranging from carpentry to sewing. These wide range of both academic and practical learning gives me a unique set of domain level knowledges that provides a great toolset for reasearch and coding. Beyond this I actively look for oppurtunities to add to learn more about subjects I'm already knowledgable in as well as completely new ones.</p>
