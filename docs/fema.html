    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Our team retrieved data from diffent API's provided by FEMA as well as data provided by the Census's SAPIE program. We analyzed these datasets together to determine if there was a difference in the amount of money recieved by a county based on that county's median income and if certain types of disaster's required more relief aid than others. In the end our initial findings were that income did not appear to play a role in the amount of aid given to a county, but relief aid was largely impacted by the type of disaster.</p>
